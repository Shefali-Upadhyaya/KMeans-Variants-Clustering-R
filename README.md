### Click [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) to get the link of the data set.
#### *The following codes are to be run in RStudio.*

1. kmeans.r file contains the basic steps for running k-means clustering algorithm 
2. nokmeans.r file contains the normalized version of k-means clustering algorithm 
3. fkmeans.r file contains the basic steps for running fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm
4. nofkmeans.r file contains the normalized version of fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm
5. time.r file contains the basic steps needed to calculate the time taken by a particular algorithm to fetch results
